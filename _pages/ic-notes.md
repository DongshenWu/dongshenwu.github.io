Below are the notes I took during lectures in Imperial College London, as well as cheatsheets (cs) I compiled in preparation for exams. The source codes need to be used with this header.tex. Some programming based courses are omitted.

None of this is official. The notes are not reliable indicators for what was lectured in my year, or what will be lectured in your year, as I tend to change, add and remove contents from the notes after the lectures occur.

The creation of these notes are heavily inspired by Dexter Chua's Cambridge Notes. You can see his amazing notes on the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos here.
